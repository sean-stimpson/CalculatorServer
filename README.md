This is a low level server implementation. I did the project to learn Java's low level  
server API. The server is multi threaded so you can create multiple clients while the   
server is running. The server takes two inputs from the client, adds them together, and   
returns them to the client. It is setup to run on Localhost port 5000.  
To run:  
Run CalcServer\ServerStartup class  
Run CalcClient\CalculatorClient class  
You can create multiple instances of CalculatorClient. You may have to change the project  
settings of your IDE to allow them to run in parallel.   
Follow console prompts in CalculatorClient instances.
